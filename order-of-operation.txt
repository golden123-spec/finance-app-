Python follows a standard set of rules for operator precedence, meaning that some operations are performed before others unless you use parentheses to override the default order. Here's a concise list from highest to lowest precedence:

Parentheses and Grouping:
() â€” Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first.

Slicing, Indexing, and Function Calls:
e.g., a[i], a(), a.attr

Exponentiation:
**

Unary Operators:
+x, -x, ~x

Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, and Modulus:
*, /, //, %

Addition and Subtraction:
+, -

Bitwise Shifts:
<<, >>

Bitwise AND:
&

Bitwise XOR:
^

Bitwise OR:
|

Comparisons:
<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, is, is not, in, not in
(Comparisons all have the same precedence and can be chained.)

Boolean NOT:
not

Boolean AND:
and

Boolean OR:
or

Conditional Expression (Ternary Operator):
if - else

Lambda Expression:
lambda
